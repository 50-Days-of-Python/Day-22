# Day-22

### Add Under_Score
Create **three** functions. The first called `add_hash` takes a string and adds a hash # between the words. The second function called `add_underscore` removes the hash (#) and replaces it with an
underscore "_" The third function called `remove_underscore`,
removes the underscore and replaces it with nothing. 
For example, if you pass `Python` as an argument for the three functions, and you call them at the same time like: `print(remove_underscore(add_underscore(add_hash('Python'))))` it should return ‘Python’.

## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** If you want you can go and do extra.py also(It won't add any points on main.py has points)  
**Step 4:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.
